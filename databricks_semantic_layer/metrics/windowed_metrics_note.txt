NOTE: Window functions (rolling windows, period-to-date, cumulative sums) are NOT directly supported in Unity Catalog Metric View measure expressions.

This file is a placeholder. Windowed metrics should be implemented using:
1. Business views with window functions, then aggregate in metric view
2. Query-level calculations with window functions
3. Materialized views for pre-computed windowed metrics

See WINDOWED_METRICS_NOTE.md for complete details and workarounds.
